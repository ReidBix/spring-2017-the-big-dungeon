	Hello There!
	My name is Rocky!
	How are you?
	I'm actually doing pretty well myself, thanks for asking.
	Have you ever just sat around all day wondering what your purpose was in life?
	What does it MEAN to be a rock?
	Should I strive to be a boulder, or continue wearing down to be a pebble.
	Are rocks supposed to even have thoughts?
	Anyways, sorry for bothering you. I guess I'll be here when you come back.
	If you come back...
